# pixel daisyworld
Pixel daisyworld is an extension of Daisyworld simulation
Daisyworld is a model of an imaginary planet created by Lovelock and Andrew Watson to support the Gaia theory

## Gaia theory
Gaia theory
Actively regulated
Atmosphere constant
Destabalisation life environment interactions lead to local reset
How much life affect the environment vs natural processes

## Observations
At high luminosities,
- Large patches of black die and get splitup
- Black surrounded by white survives
- White takeover at high temp	but black dun at low prob bec unsymmetric albedo
- Great heat death is due to expansion of ground cover
- Black starts dying from the center of large patches of black


## Future work
Importance of atmosphere in the simulation
- Ocean conveyor belt disruption
- real growth temp curve
- spherical coordinate pixels
